* Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
    Yes, I tried to implement a function based on player's last disk location, so that each time the computer can place a disk around that location, to stop the user to win the game. 
    However, due to the short of time, I did not implement that function successfully. 

* If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
    No. 

* How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
    I used random.randit method to help me to generate two random number for x position and y posistion.
    If on that pisition, the board is clear, the computer will place a disk on it. 

* How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    Really depends. 
    
* How would you improve it in the future?
    There is a lot of things I would like to improve in the future:
    1. Finish the ai algorithm so that the computer can place a disk based on the strategy describe above
    2. Used TensorFlow to analyze users' playing behaviors, and the AI can apply different playing strategies when playing against different players
    3. With more games played, the AI should be able to improve its playing strategies by implementing a machine learning model.
